# gnome-init (dotgnome)

Some scripted GNOME bits so I don't have to do this every time.

## GNOME Stuff

```sh
./install
```

## Packages

You will want to run https://github.com/deobald/dotfiles and
https://github.com/deobald/dotemacs before this step, probably.

```sh
./install-debs
```

Once you're done, run `emacs` to let it self-heal or whatever.
